      <h1>Dad Rising: A Family Adventure</h1>
      <p>Hello, Emmanuel!</p>
      <p>You have now arrived at the family's summer house. Your parents stay here for a few weeks.<br>The
            inevitable has
            however happened and your dad has been rehearsing his classical jokes for weeks, waiting for a moment of
            weakness to knock you or worse, your mom, partner or children, out,
            with a joke you've heard your whole life.<br>He could be lurking
            anywhere,
            ready to crack anyone up!<br>Will you be able to save them in time?<br>Will you be able to survive? Only
            time will
            show... Good luck!</p>
      <br>
