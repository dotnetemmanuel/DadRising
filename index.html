      <h1>Family vs Dad Jokes</h1>
      <p>Hello, Emmanuel!</p>
      <p>You have now arrived at the hotel. Your whole family stays here for the annual family reunion.<br>The
            inevitable has
            however happened and your dad has been rehearsing his classical jokes for weeks, waiting for a weak cousin,
            or
            worse, your own children to, in a moment of weakness, knock them out with a dad joke.<br>He could be
            anywhere,
            ready to crack anyone up!<br>Will you be able to save them in time?<br>Will you be able to survive? Only
            time will
            show... Good luck!</p>
      <p>Now, when you're ready, turn on the lights!</p>
