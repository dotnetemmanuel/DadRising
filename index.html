      <h1>Dad Rising: A Family Adventure</h1>
      <p>Hello, Emmanuel!</p>
      <p>You have now arrived at the family's summer house. Your parents will stay here with you for a few weeks. The
            inevitable has
            however happened and your dad has been rehearsing his classical jokes for weeks, waiting for a moment of
            weakness to knock you or worse, your mom, partner or children, out,
            with a joke you've heard your whole life. He could be lurking
            anywhere, ready to crack anyone up! Will you be able to save them in time? Will you be able to save
            yourself?</p>
